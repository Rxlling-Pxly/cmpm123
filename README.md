I don't think the logger I've built is all that impressive, but I haven't used C/C++ in years and am rustier than I expected.
I also have never used Dear ImGui before.
Coming into this assignment as rusty and unknowledgeable, I was able to complete it using multiple sources of help:
- I used websites such as GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools to learn how to do things in C++ such as making a class.
- I used websites such as cppreference to learn about standard libarary methods.
- I used ChatGPT for bugfixing, refactoring, and learning about C++ conventions and features, e.g. "What does it mean when a function returns something with an & after it?"
- And lastly I examined the code in the imgui folder to learn how to use it. 

I did not ask the professor any questions regarding this logger assignment both in person and in Discord.
However, I did read through the "class-questions" channel in Discord and found it very helpful.
